## About Git

### Git : fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
> "By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git."

> "Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members."
